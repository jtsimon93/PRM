# Contributing to PRM Project

Thank you for considering contributing to the PRM project! We welcome all contributions and appreciate your help in improving the software.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Open an Issue

Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, please open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jtsimon93/PRM/issues) to discuss your ideas. This helps us:
- Avoid duplicate efforts.
- Ensure the idea aligns with the project's goals and roadmap.
- Provide feedback and guidance before you spend time on implementation.

### 2. Fork the Repository

If your contribution is approved, fork the repository and create a new branch for your work. Use descriptive branch names that explain the purpose of the branch (e.g., `fix-bug-issue-123` or `add-new-feature`).

### 3. Write Clear, Concise Code

- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- Add comments and documentation where necessary.
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes to ensure code quality.

### 4. Commit Messages

Write clear and meaningful commit messages. A good commit message should describe what was changed and why.

### 5. Pull Request

Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch. In your PR, please:
- Reference the issue number it addresses (e.g., `Closes #123`).
- Provide a clear description of the changes and why they are necessary.
- Ensure all tests pass and your code adheres to the project's coding standards.

### 6. Code Review

One or more project maintainers will review your pull request. Please be responsive to feedback and be prepared to make changes to your code. Discussions during code review help improve the overall quality of the project.
